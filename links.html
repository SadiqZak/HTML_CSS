    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>Example of adding an <a href="images.html">image</a></p>

    <p>This particular page is all about links! There are three types of links</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"target='_blank'>Mozilla Documents Network</a> serves as a great learning source for web developers</li>
        <li>Relative links, link to our <a href="extras.html">extras page</a> <p>“Relative” links point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file you’re editing. It’s implied that the scheme and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need to supply is the path.</p> </li>
        <li>Root-relative, link to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
            but those aren't useful to us right now <p>“Root-relative” links are similar to the previous section, but instead of being relative to the current page, they’re relative to the “root” of the entire website. For instance, if your website is hosted on our-site.com, all root-relative URLs will be relative to our-site.com.</p> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This page is about miscellaneous things on the internet, You maybe interested in <a href="../links.html">links</a> or <a href="images.html">images</a></p>
